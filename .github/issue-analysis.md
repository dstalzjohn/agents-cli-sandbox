# Issue #1: Refactor that this works also with docker and check if the image still

## Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements
- Ensure Docker container builds successfully
- Verify Docker container runs correctly
- Support both Docker and Podman container runtimes
- Maintain compatibility with existing functionality
- Ensure proper volume mounting and environment variable handling

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Container should build efficiently with proper layer caching
- Security: Follow Docker security best practices (non-root user, minimal base image)
- Scalability: Support multiple container instances if needed
- Portability: Work across different host systems (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL)

## Technical Approach
### Architecture Decision
- Pattern: Multi-stage builds and runtime-agnostic configuration
- Rationale: Improve build caching, reduce final image size, support both Docker and Podman

### Implementation Plan
1. Add .dockerignore file to optimize build context (15min)
2. Create docker-compose.yml for easier container orchestration (30min)
3. Update Makefile to support both Docker and Podman (20min)
4. Fix PATH issues in Dockerfile (10min)
5. Add health check to ensure container is running properly (10min)
6. Test with both Docker and Podman (30min)

## Test Strategy
- Build test with Docker
- Build test with Podman
- Runtime test with volume mounts
- Environment variable passing test
- Interactive shell access test
- Edge cases: Missing .env file, network issues during build

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Docker image builds without errors
- [ ] Container runs and stays alive
- [ ] All services (git, gh CLI, Python, npm) work inside container
- [ ] Both Docker and Podman are supported
- [ ] Volume mounts work correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are properly passed
